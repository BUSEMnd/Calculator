I made a calculator with Java FX. It does addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
You can write the number in decimals, but you can also write it in percentages.
It does multiplication and division operations first and then addition and subtraction operations, so it has operation priority.
There is a user login. You enter your name and password and register, it recognizes you when you want to enter again.
I added history, that is, it records the operations you do, when you turn off the calculator, you can see the operations you do if you want to enter again.
